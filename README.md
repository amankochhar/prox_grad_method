Implementation of proximal gradient descent method for sparse dataset

An efficient proximal-gradient method that
achieves a faster convergence rate and is much more efficient and scalable than solving the SOCP
formulation. This method exploits the structure of the non-smooth structured-sparsity-inducing
norm, introduces its smooth approximation, and solves this approximation function instead of
optimizing the original objective function directly.
